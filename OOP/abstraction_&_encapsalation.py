"""
why OOP?
with object oriented programming, the goal is to encapsulate your code into logical, 
hierarchical groupings using classes so that you can reason about your code at a higher level


Encapsulation:
-the grouping of public and private attributes and 
mthods into a programmatic class, making abstraction possible

example:
-designing the deck class, i make cards a private attribute (a list)
-i decide that the length of the cards should be accessed via a public 
method called count() --i.e. Deck.count()

Abstraction:
- exposing only "relevant" data in a class interface, hiding 
private attributes and methods (aka the "inner workings" ) from users
