Polymorphism

* a key principle in OOP is the idea of polymorphism - 
an object can take on many(poly) forms(morph)
*while a formal definition of polymorphism is more difficult, 
there are two important practical applications

"""
Polymorphism and inheritance

1. the same class method works in a similar way for different classes
a common implementation of this is to have a method in a bse (or parent)
class that is overridden by a subclass. This is called method overriding
-each subclass will have a different implementation of the method.

2. (Polymorphism) The same operation works for differnet kinds of
objects.
- How does the following work in python?

Python classes have special (also known as "magic") methods, that
are dunders(I.e. double underscore-named).

these are methods with special names that give instructions to
python for how to deal with objects.
