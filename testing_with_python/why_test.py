**Why test?
-reduce bugs in existing code 
-ensure bugs that are fixed stay fixed 
-ensure that new features don't break old ones
-ensure that cleaning up code doesn't introduce new bugs
-makes development more fun!

**Test Driven Development (TDD)
-development begins by writing tests
-once tests are written, write code to make tests pass
-once tests pass, a feature is considered complete

** Red, Green, Refactor
red - write a test that fails
Green - Write the minimal amount of code
necessary to make the test pass
refactor - clean up the code, while ensure that test still pass
